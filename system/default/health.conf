[feature:searchheadconnectivity]
display_name = Search Head Connectivity

indicator:master_connectivity:red = 1

[feature:slave_state]
display_name = Slave State
indicator:slave_state:description = This indicator gauges whether the cluster peer is in an abnormal state. For example, manual detention will result in Yellow, and automatic detention will result in Red. You can disable this indicator by setting the threshold to 0.
indicator:slave_state:red = 1
indicator:slave_state:yellow = 1

[feature:slave_version]
display_name = Slave Version

[feature:shc_captain_election_overview]
display_name = SHC Captain Election
indicator:dynamic_captain_quorum:description = This indicator tracks whether quorum majority required to re-elect a dynamic captain has been lost. Yellow occurs when half or more members are down, Green otherwise. This feature can be disabled when a static captain is being used instead of a dynamic captain. However, we recommend keeping the feature enabled if static captain is being used only for disaster recovery.

indicator:archived_buckets_failed_last_24h:description = This indicator tracks the amount of buckets that were attempted to be archived into Glacier but failed.
